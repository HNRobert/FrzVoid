A Windows app enabling you to prevent specific programmes from running

## Instructions

If this is running, it continuously prevents some pieces of software from running for more than 1 sec since it's started.

You can add some apps-to-kill through editing the names of their .exe files in the textbox of the main root, split by '|' .

You can also start it upon Windows startup.

## Furthermore...

Using this, you can prevent your naughty kids from installing any weird app or game on your beloved PC
and making it messy, as long as you know their names ;)

This is a simple program though, but enjoy it!
