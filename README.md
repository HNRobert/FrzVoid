# FrzVoid
 A Windows app enabling you to prevent sepcific softwares from running

## Instructions

### FrzVoid.exe

If this is running, it continuously prevents some softwares from running for more than 3 sec since it's started.

You can edit the names of the softwares to kill in the textbox of it's main root, split by ','

### Windows Process Defender.exe

This is a tool made to help you keep the FrzVoid.exe continuously running and making it unstopable.

As the moment you run it for the first time, it will set itself to start with windows

When it's running, if it finds that the FrzVoid.exe isn't running, it will start it immediately.

## Further more...

This app ISN'T STABLE accroding to long term tests, and there's still a lot of things that can be improved.

It's written for fun, and to test if a function in my mind is feasible, and the answer is yes, actually (bullshit)

Using this, you can prevent your naughty kids from installing any werid app or game on your beloved PC,
and making it messy after all ;)

If I get some more spare time, I will optimise this carefully, or you can do this as well!
