A Windows app enabling you to prevent specific programmes from running

## Instructions

If this is running, it continuously prevents some pieces of software from running for more than 1 sec since it's started.

You can add some apps-to-kill through editing the names of their .exe files in the textbox of the main root, split with '|' .

It also supports identifying the previously blocked apps even if their names are changed, and that's the "Banned apps tracking" function.

Through checking or unchecking the specific apps' firstly detected routes in the menu, you can decide which apps to track.

You can also start it upon Windows startup.

> Warning: **Better NOT include a too-short word or even one character in the target options**, for example, entering an 'e' and applying it would stop "explorer.exe" (actually all the .exes) from working, and then you know what would happen next.

## Furthermore...

Using this, you can prevent your naughty kids from installing any weird app or game on your beloved PC
and making it messy, as long as you know their names ;)

This is a simple program though, but enjoy it!
